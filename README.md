# ðŸ§ª Exploratory Data Analysis on Cardiographic Dataset

This project performs a detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the `cardiographic.csv` dataset to uncover insights into fetal heart rate (FHR) and related medical indicators.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
- Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis  
- Explore distributions and relationships between variables  
- Detect patterns, correlations, and possible anomalies  
- Provide actionable insights from the cardiographic data

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description

The dataset contains multiple medical indicators related to fetal well-being:

- **LB** â†’ Baseline Fetal Heart Rate (FHR)  
- **AC** â†’ Accelerations  
- **FM** â†’ Fetal Movements  
- **UC** â†’ Uterine Contractions  
- **DL** â†’ Decelerations Late  
- **DS** â†’ Decelerations Short  
- **DP** â†’ Decelerations Prolonged  
- **ASTV** â†’ % Time with Abnormal Short Term Variability  
- **MSTV** â†’ Mean Short Term Variability  
- **ALTV** â†’ % Time with Abnormal Long Term Variability  
- **MLTV** â†’ Mean Long Term Variability

## ðŸ”¹ Tasks Completed

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Handled missing values  
   - Fixed data type inconsistencies  
   - Detected and treated outliers  

2. **Statistical Summary**
   - Mean, Median, Std. Dev., IQR for all numerical variables  
   - Highlighted unusual distributions  

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Histograms & Boxplots â†’ distributions & outliers  
   - Bar Charts â†’ frequency of categorical variables  
   - Scatter Plots & Heatmaps â†’ correlation analysis  
   - Advanced plots (Pair plots, Violin plots) for deeper exploration  

4. **Pattern Recognition & Insights**
